Airlines_FareCalculation

Author: Luwam Gebrezgiabhier
Overview

This program simulates a simple airline fare calculation system. It calculates flight fares based on various factors such as fare class, distance, seasonality (peak or off-peak), and booking demand. It also allows for storing flight data to a file and displaying relevant flight and passenger details.

Key Features:
Calculate fares based on different fare classes (Economy, Business, First Class).
Apply seasonality surcharge during peak seasons.
Adjust fare based on demand (price increases when fewer seats are available).
Factor in distance for additional charges on long-haul flights.
Allow users to view flight and passenger details.
Save flight data to a file for persistence.

main.cpp: The main program file that ties everything together and runs the program.
flights.txt: Output file where flight data is saved.

How to compile:
Use c++ compiler
